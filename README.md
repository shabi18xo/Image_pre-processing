Project Description
Damaged Car Image Preprocessing Pipeline for Computer Vision using OpenCV

This project focuses on building a robust image preprocessing pipeline specifically designed for images of damaged vehicles. The main goal is to enhance the quality and uniformity of these images to make them suitable for further computer vision tasks such as damage detection, severity assessment, and automated insurance claims.

The pipeline utilizes OpenCV, a powerful open-source computer vision library, to apply a series of preprocessing techniques. These may include image resizing, grayscale conversion, denoising, histogram equalization, edge detection (e.g., Canny), and contour detection to isolate regions of interest. The preprocessing helps in reducing noise, improving image clarity, and highlighting damaged areas for better performance in subsequent machine learning or deep learning models.

To enhance user interaction and provide real-time visual feedback, the pipeline is wrapped in an intuitive Streamlit web application. Users can upload car images, apply different preprocessing steps interactively, and visualize the outputs instantly.

This project not only demonstrates core skills in Python and OpenCV, but also introduces basic computer vision concepts and showcases the ability to deploy interactive tools using Streamlit.
